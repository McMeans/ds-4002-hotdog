For UVA's DS 4002

-- Provenance : Past life of data, where did data come from
Source: Data was collected through a survey of UVA undergraduate students during Fall 2025.

Method: The survey was distributed via Discord channels.

Sample Size: 207 respondents

Survey Questions:

What year are you in? (First, Second, Third, Fourth, Other)

Do you consider a hot dog to be a sandwich? (Yes, No, Unsure)

Response Format: Multiple choice (Yes, No, Unsure).

Limitations: Not a random sample of the entire UVA population; relies on voluntary responses.

-- Management Plan : Future (ex, GitHub):

The data is stored here in our class GitHub repo so it can be reused in the future. Later semesters may add new rounds of surveys, or even new questions, so the dataset can grow over time. Weâ€™ve included documentation like a data dictionary, so anyone coming back to this project will be able to understand and build on it. 

-- Data Dictionary : Provide understanding for the data (ex, observations, features and their units)

-- Uncertainty : margin of error, prone to randomness

-- Ethics : Any bias?
