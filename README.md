For UVA's DS 4002

-- Provenance : Past life of data, where did data come from
Source: Data was collected through a survey of UVA undergraduate students during Fall 2025.

Method: The survey was distributed via Discord channels.

Sample Size: 207 respondents

Survey Questions:

What year are you in? (First, Second, Third, Fourth, Other)

Do you consider a hot dog to be a sandwich? (Yes, No, Unsure)

Response Format: Multiple choice (Yes, No, Unsure).

Limitations: Not a random sample of the entire UVA population; relies on voluntary responses.

-- Management Plan : Future (ex, GitHub):

The data is stored here in our class GitHub repo so it can be reused in the future. Later semesters may add new rounds of surveys, or even new questions, so the dataset can grow over time. We’ve included documentation like a data dictionary, so anyone coming back to this project will be able to understand and build on it. 

-- Data Dictionary : Provide understanding for the data (ex, observations, features and their units)

-- Uncertainty : margin of error, prone to randomness:
There are some natural limitations to keep in mind. The survey wasn’t random, it reached whoever happened to see it in certain spaces, which means some groups of students were more likely to respond than others. We may also have more answers from certain years than others, depending on who it was shared with. And since the total number of responses is fairly small, the results could easily shift if more people participated. All of this means the dataset gives us a fun snapshot of opinions, but not a perfect or definitive answer.

-- Ethics : Any bias? 
The survey was completely anonymous and voluntary, and no personal or sensitive data was collected. Our main ethical responsibility here is to be honest about what the data does and doesn’t represent. We can’t claim it reflects every UVA student, and that’s okay — it’s mainly an exercise in collecting and analyzing data responsibly.
